## Mail Archiver

Mail Archiver is a desktop application developed as part of a college assignment using the Visual Basic .NET programming language. The goal of this project was to implement all concepts learned during the course by creating a functional mail archiving system. The application allows organizations to manage and archive incoming and outgoing mail using a mail number as the primary reference. It is directly connected to a MySQL database to ensure efficient storage and retrieval of mail records.
